Very quickly. Props to the folks at angular in helping us write this contrib doc ([see original](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)). We think its awesome üòç. At the moment we don't have enough time to come up with our own. We just want to lay down some of the groundwork to get us rolling. üòâ. If you would like to contribute please take a look at the contrib doc: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nimb3s/nimb3s/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We look forward to your contributions :full_moon_with_face:.
